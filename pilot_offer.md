# Nebula Labs — Pilot Offer

**Project:** CAS (Surgical Neural Reconfiguration) — Proof-of-Value Pilot  
**Duration options:** Audit (1 week), Short Pilot (3 weeks), Full Pilot (3 months)

**Intro (one line):** We provide a compact, reproducible evaluation of CAS on your model/data to assess whether surgical reconfiguration can reduce retraining cost (TCO) and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

---

## Tier 1 — Quick Audit (recommended first step)
- **Price:** $1,500
- **Duration:** 5–10 business days
- **Deliverable:** 3–5 page feasibility report + one reproducible run on a small sample; recommendations.
- **Partner ask:** 1 small sample dataset (<= 10k samples) or model endpoint + POC contact.
- **Payment:** 100% upfront
- **Why:** Low-risk, fast validation to decide whether to proceed.

## Tier 2 — Short Pilot (proof-of-value)
- **Price:** $5,000
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Deliverable:** reproducible code + integration on scoped slice, evaluation report (TCO estimate, forgetting metric N seeds), playbook for scale.
- **Partner ask:** sandbox environment or data access for scoped subset, weekly sync.
- **Payment:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- **Success:** pre-agreed KPI (example: ≥25% estimated TCO reduction or statistically significant forgetting reduction on scoped tasks).

## Tier 3 — Full Pilot / Evaluation
- **Price:** $15,000 – $50,000 (negotiable)
- **Duration:** 3 months
- **Deliverable:** full integration, monitoring, extended evaluations, safety checks, rollback tests, handover playbook.
- **Partner ask:** environment access, engineering collaboration, SLA terms.
- **Payment:** milestone-based
- **Success:** contractually agreed KPIs and pathway to production.
